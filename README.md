A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`.

The application is a game Rock-paper-scissors is an old schoolyard game that can be used for quick decision making.
In the usual setup, there are two players. After the chant of “Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot” both players show a hand gesture that either indicates a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. Scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, and rock beats scissors. If the two players come up with the same gesture, then it is a tie.
